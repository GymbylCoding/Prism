  type = "none", "random", "angular", "angularSequential", "awayFromOffsetPosition", "towardsOffsetPosition", "towardsOffsetPositionClamped", "customFunction"
  -> "none" means particles are still
     "random" means particles move in random directions
     "angular" means particles move randomly from a list of angles
     "angularSequential" means particles cycle through the list of angles
     "awayFromOffsetPosition" means particles move away from the offset (targetOffsetX/Y)
     "towardsOffsetPosition" means particles move towards the offset
     "towardsOffsetPositionClamped" means particles move to the offset position (only available when method = "transition")
     "customFunction" means particles move according to the getVelocity() function (not available when method = "transition")

  angle = {"0-45", "135-180", 90}

  -> "frameBased" means Prism moves particles itself (default if no method is provided; this is the most customizeable method)
     "physics" means particles get Box2D physics bodies
     "transition" means Prism moves particles via Corona transitions
